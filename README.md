### Landing page
This project is a **Personal Landing Page** developed using only **HTML and CSS**.  
It was built as a hands-on practice to learn frontend development basics like layout, styling, and responsive design.

### 🎯 Purpose:
As a student learning web development, I wanted to challenge myself to build something from scratch — without using any frameworks or templates — and understand how websites are structured and styled.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **HTML5** – for page structure  
- **CSS3** – for design and layout  
- **FontAwesome** – for icons  
- **Google Forms** – for the contact form submission  
- **Google Sheets** – to store user data (form responses)

---

### 📦 Features:
- Fully responsive landing page layout  
- Clean, minimal design  
- Contact form ("Let's Connect") that redirects to a Thank You page  
- Branding with custom name: **JEKSMITH**  
- Thank You page UI inspired by modern web design
